Hi, Guys!

I'm the webmaster at Vulcan Riders Sweden.
We are chapter 46 of the international Vulcan Riders Association
The purpose with the association is to gether people who rides Kawasaki Vulcan motorcycles - there crusing bikes - aroun the world.
In our Swedish chapter we are just under six thousend members.
Since we lives all over the contry we have our "club houe" on internett.
And you are welcome to visit us att - http://www.vulcanriders-sweden.org.

Just now, 2016-11-03, I am building a new websiteand hope to have it ready for release sometime mid to late 1917.
All work is done voluntarily and on spare time in the same way as all the other work of the association. 
Most of us functionaries are additionally self-taught amateurs at what we do - admittedly, however, with great interest.
